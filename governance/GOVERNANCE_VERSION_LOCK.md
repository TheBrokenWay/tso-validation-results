# Predator X — Governance & Version Lock

The Predator X platform enforces constitutional governance and strict version locking across all scientific engines and physics layers.

## 1. Constitutional Enforcement (OPA)
OPA enforces:
- Olympus constraint‑first rules  
- Version‑lock requirements  
- Safety thresholds  
- Forbidden paradoxes  

Governance is externalized and cannot be bypassed by code changes.

## 2. Hydra Configuration Governance
Hydra ensures:
- All parameters are versioned  
- All seeds are auditable  
- All simulation configurations are reproducible  

## 3. Version‑Locked Engines
The following engines are pinned:
- **OPE_ADMET_V3**  
- **TRIAL_ENGINE_V1**  
- **TOXICITY_HARD_LIMIT**  
- **PK_ENGINE_V1**  
- **EVIDENCE_PACKAGE_V1**  

No legacy engines or paths are permitted.

## 4. Physics Versioning (DVC)
- 3,340 Physics Maps are versioned  
- Full lineage tracking  
- Time‑travel to any warehouse state  

## 5. Governance Validation
- Thermodynamic paradox → rejected  
- Temporal paradox → rejected  

The governance layer is fully operational.
