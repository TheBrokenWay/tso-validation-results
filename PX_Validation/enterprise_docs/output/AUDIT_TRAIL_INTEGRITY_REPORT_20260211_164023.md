## 1. Sovereign Log Chain (SLC)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Entries | 1112 |
| First Entry | 2026-02-02T23:54:25.557118+00:00 |
| Last Entry | 2026-02-11T16:40:23.606788+00:00 |
| Chain Hash | `2d8e25577cdc8c49437156c899a969db...` |
| Chain Integrity | INTACT |
| Hash Algorithm | SHA-256 |

The Sovereign Log Chain is an immutable, SHA-256-chained audit trail.
Every governance decision, engine evaluation, and finalization event
is recorded with a cryptographic link to the previous entry.

## 2. WorldLine Physics Snapshots

| Tier | Count |
|------|-------|
| Bronze | 5332 |
| Silver | 266 |
| Gold | 8 |
| Diamond | 21 |
| **Total** | **5627** |

WorldLines are 35D physics state snapshots for every candidate attempt
(pass or fail). They build a complete failure/success map and are
**irreplaceable learning data** — never deleted.

## 3. Dossier Inventory
