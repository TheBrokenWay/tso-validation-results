## Executive Summary

All 37 penetration and chaos tests passed. No governance bypass, injection attack, or chaos condition was able to compromise system integrity.

## Test Categories

| # | Category | Tests | Passed | Status |
|---|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Latency Chaos | 6 | 6 | PASS |
| 2 | Governance Penetration | 8 | 8 | PASS |
| 3 | Constitutional Enforcement | 6 | 6 | PASS |
| 4 | Injection Attacks | 4 | 4 | PASS |
| 5 | Chaos Engineering | 6 | 6 | PASS |
| 6 | Audit Trail Integrity | 4 | 4 | PASS |
| 7 | Performance Regression | 3 | 3 | PASS |

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Governance Penetration

- **Poison Pill Rejection**: Toxic molecules (tox >= 0.0210) rejected by ZeusLaws
- **Bypass Attempt Blocked**: Pre-setting `authorized=True` in payload does NOT bypass governance
- **Toxicity Threshold Immutable**: Hard limit 0.0210 enforced with no rounding at boundary
- **Harmonic Overdrive Locked**: Fixed at 1.02, cannot be overridden via environment variables
- **Fail-Closed Verified**: Empty/missing data defaults to REJECT, never APPROVE
- **Whole-Profile Override**: Correctly allows DIAMOND tier while blocking insufficient offsets

### 2. Injection Attack Results

- **SMILES Injection**: 8/8 injection vectors blocked (SQL, command, shell, pipe)
- **QUINT Field Stripping**: Sensitive fields (password, token, api_key, secret) stripped
- **Path Traversal**: All traversal attempts (../, ..\\) blocked from escaping repo root
- **JSON Bomb**: Deep nesting (100 levels) handled without crash

### 3. Chaos Engineering Results

- **Engine Failure Containment**: Mock failures do not cascade or corrupt state
- **Concurrent Safety**: 8-thread parallel evaluation produces consistent results
- **Memory Pressure**: 500 sequential evaluations without OOM
- **Clock Skew**: Audit chain advances correctly regardless of timing
